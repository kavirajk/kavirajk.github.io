I"ˆ<p>Itâ€™s common to split windows while working in emacs. By default, whenever we
split windows in emacs the newly created window will also have the same
buffer(same buffer in two windows). So it is always needed
to change to another buffer by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C-x b</code> after splitting it.</p>
